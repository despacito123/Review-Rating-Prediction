# Review-Rating-Prediction

The task is to predict the ratings based on the 5-core [dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) of reviews for movies and TV on Amazon, in which all users and items have at least 5 reviews. When I first saw the dataset, two different types of models come to my mind. The first type is matrix factorization model based on the reviewer-item ratings, which is widely used in recommender system. The second type is a text classifier based purely on the review text content. It is essentially sentiment analysis for this kind of rating problem. I will first try both type of models independently, and then check if combination of two models can lead to better performance.
